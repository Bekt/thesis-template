When I was writing my undergraduate thesis, I could not find any
template that was simple and short. Thus, I came up with this. 
This template requires no external dependencies.

The title and signature pages follow the University of Arkansas
undergraduate Honors College requirements (2015). 
However, feel free to modify them according to your needs.

Get started:

Take a look at `Paper.tex`.

```bash
pdflatex Paper.tex
open Paper.pdf
```

`pdflatex` is just an example.
It generates the `Paper.pdf` file.
You can use whatever distribution or IDE you prefer to compile.
